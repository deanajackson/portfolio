# Portfolio Project using HTML, CSS and Vanilla Javascrpt

This project was made for an introductory web development course.
The code repository can be found [here](https://github.com/deanajackson/portfolio)
The live site is deployed here.

## Styles

The color scheme was selected from the [Canva theme "Middle Eastern Empire"](https://www.canva.com/colors/color-palettes/middle-eastern-empire/)
The font is called [Lekton from Google Fonts](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lekton)

I used media queries to apply different styles and structures to mobile, tablet and desktop views. Some of the main differences are the use of grids for the desktop view, the presence or absence of the stylized initials in the contact form div and the size of images.

I made heavy use of class and id names, but also choose to use tag names occasionally when I really did want all related tag elements to have a certain style.

## Navigation

The navigation bar also changes depending on the mobile or desktop view. This was the sample navbar from a previous web dev class I took. I reused it here because it is highly responsive. It uses Bootstrap CSS and JS. It uses classes such as navbar-brand and navbar-collapse.
To learn more about Bootstrap Navbars here is their [Navbar Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.3/components/navbar/)
It's important to note that I am using version 3.3.5 of Bootstrap which is still supported but there are newer versions out there.
